## Project Overview üöÄ

This repository is a robust template for Python development using **Poetry** and isolated virtual environments,
delivering a consistent and reproducible local package workflow. It comes equipped with tools for testing, formatting,
linting, spell-checking, a ready-to-use devcontainer, custom VS Code settings, essential repo files, automated checks,
integrated VS Code extensions, semantic releases, automated documentation deployment, and extensive in-repo guides for
project management and customization.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Devcontainer & VS Code:** Ubuntu-based Docker container with Python 3.12 and Poetry installed, plus recommended VS
  Code extensions and workspace settings.
- **Dependency Management:** Poetry for declarative `pyproject.toml` configuration and `poetry.lock` locking.
- **Virtual Environments:** Project-scoped `.venv` directory automatically managed by Poetry (no need to install or
  activate manually).
- **Linting & Formatting:** Ruff for Python, Prettier for JSON/Markdown/YAML; enforced via pre-commit hooks and editor
  integrations.
- **Type Checking:** MyPy with automatic installation of missing stub packages.
- **Testing:** pytest suite with coverage reporting.
- **Spell Checking:** cspell for both code and documentation.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Automates Ruff, MyPy, pytest, rstfmt, yamllint, markdownlint, markdown-link-check, pyupgrade,
  and more.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for linting, testing, semantic-release versioning, and Sphinx docs deployment.
- **Documentation:** Sphinx configured with `autoapi`, `napoleon`, and `viewcode`; live preview during development and
  publishing to GitHub Pages.

- **In-Repo Guides:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md`, `SECURITY.md` to enforce best practices and streamline
  onboarding.

## Installation üì¶

Designed for **GitHub Codespaces**‚Äîrunning locally is untested and may require extra configuration.

[![open-in-github-codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)][open-in-codespaces]

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Most manual quality checks and workflows are exposed via `Makefile` targets. These commands mirror the editor
integrations, pre-commit hooks, and CI pipelines.

### CLI

Invoke the project‚Äôs command-line interface:

```bash
poetry run cli --help
```

### Formatting

Most formatting tasks are automated and enforced using various tools. Feel free to adjust these settings for your
project. The repository configurations are described in the [`STYLEGUIDE.md`][STYLEGUIDE].

```bash
make format             # check formatting
make format-fix         # apply formatting fixes
```

### Linting

```bash
make lint               # detect lint issues
make lint-fix           # auto-fix lint issues
```

### Static Analysis

- **Type Checking** with MyPy

  ```bash
  make type
  ```

- **Spell Checking** with cspell

  ```bash
  make spell
  ```

### Testing

Run the test suite (with coverage):

```bash
make test
```

### Documentation

- **Build HTML docs** with Sphinx:

  ```bash
  make docs-build
  ```

- **Live-serve docs** locally:

  ```bash
  make docs-serve
  ```

- **Clean docs** build artifacts:

  ```bash
  make docs-clean
  ```
