## Project Overview üöÄ

This repository is a robust template for Python development on **PEP 582** (`__pypackages__`), delivering a zero-install
local package workflow. It comes equipped with tools for testing, formatting, linting, spell checking, a ready-to-use
devcontainer, custom VS Code settings, essential repo files, automated checks, integrated VS Code extensions, semantic
releases, automated documentation deployment, and extensive in-repo guides for project management and customization.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Devcontainer & VS Code:** Ubuntu-based Docker container with Python 3.12, PDM, PEP 582 support, recommended VS Code
  extensions and workspace settings.
- **Dependency Management:** PDM for declarative `pyproject.toml` builds and lock files.
- **PEP 582 Support:** Local `__pypackages__` directory eliminates need for virtual environments.
- **Linting & Formatting:** Ruff for Python, Prettier for JSON/Markdown/YAML, enforced via pre-commit and editor
  integrations.
- **Type Checking:** MyPy with auto-install of missing types.
- **Testing:** pytest suite with coverage reporting.
- **Spell Checking:** cspell for code and docs.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Automates Ruff, MyPy, pytest, rstfmt, yamllint, markdownlint, markdown-link-check, pyupgrade,
  and more.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for lint/test, semantic-release, and Sphinx docs deployment.
- **Documentation:** Sphinx with `autoapi`, `napoleon`, and `viewcode` extensions; live preview and GitHub Pages
  publishing.
- **In-Repo Guides:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md`, `SECURITY.md` to enforce best practices and streamline
  onboarding.

## Installation üì¶

Designed for **GitHub Codespaces**‚Äîrunning locally is untested and may require extra configuration.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

Most manual quality checks and workflows are exposed via npm and PDM scripts. These commands mirror the editor
integrations, pre-commit hooks, and CI pipelines.

### CLI

Invoke the project‚Äôs command-line interface:

```bash
pdm cli --help
```

### Formatting & Linting

Most formatting tasks are automated and enforced using various tools. Feel free to adjust these settings for your
project. The repository configurations are described in the [`STYLEGUIDE.md`][STYLEGUIDE].

- **Prettier** (non-Python files)

  ```bash
  npm run format        # check formatting
  npm run format-fix    # apply formatting fixes
  ```

- **Ruff** (Python code)

  ```bash
  pdm lint              # detect lint issues
  pdm lint-fix          # auto-fix lint issues
  pdm format            # apply Ruff‚Äôs formatter
  ```

### Static Analysis

- **Type Checking** with MyPy

  ```bash
  pdm type
  ```

- **Spell Checking** with cspell

  ```bash
  npm run spell
  ```

### Testing

Run the test suite (with coverage):

```bash
pdm test
```

### Documentation

- **Format docs** (reStructuredText):

  ```bash
  pdm docs-format
  ```

- **Build HTML docs** with Sphinx:

  ```bash
  pdm docs-build
  ```

- **Live-serve docs** locally:

  ```bash
  pdm docs-serve
  ```

- **Clean docs** build artifacts:

  ```bash
  pdm docs-clean
  ```
